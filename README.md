# 🔥 React.js FrontEnd Employees 🔥 
Welcome to my project! It's great to have you here. 😉 

This project was done at the beginning of learning ReactJS, and its goal was to learn how to use components and what each component consists of. 
There are no states or anything similar in this project because its purpose is only to deal with components ( No functionality on it )


Skills: React.js, JSX, CSS
